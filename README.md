This repository demonstrates a common Python programming error: forgetting to close a file opened with `open()`. The `bug.py` file contains a function that opens a file but doesn't close it, leading to potential resource leaks. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.py`. The solution utilizes the `with` statement which guarantees the file is closed even if errors occur.  Always use the `with` statement when working with files in Python to ensure proper resource management.
